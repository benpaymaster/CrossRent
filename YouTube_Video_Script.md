### **INTRO - "The Problem" (30 seconds) [0:00-0:30]**
**[Screen: Show yourself on camera, then cut to presentation slide]**

**Script:**
"Hi! I'm [Your Name], and I want to show you CrossRent - a solution to a massive problem affecting 50 million students and renters globally.

**[Show slide with survey results]**

From our 17-person survey at this hackathon:
- 76% of students struggled to pay rental deposits 
- 82% want a reputation system for rent payments
- 89% prefer USDC over traditional banking

Traditional rental deposits are broken. Students lose money, landlords take risks, and nobody builds credit from rent payments."

Step 1: I connect my wallet. CrossRent creates a secure dev-controlled wallet for me instantly.

It's funded with 1000 USDC for testing. In reality, students would deposit their own money.

**[Open payment dialog]**
Step 2: I make a rent payment. Let me pay $800 USDC for a property.

**[Fill out payment form quickly]**
- Property address: 123 Student Housing St
- Amount: $800 USDC  
- Duration: 6 months

**[Submit payment]**
Step 3: Payment processed! Look at this:

**[Show success screen with green checkmark]**
✅ DEPOSIT RECEIVED - The landlord is instantly notified
